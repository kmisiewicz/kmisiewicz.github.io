title: Using Selected Gaze Parameters To Interact With Vitrual Environments - Master's Thesis
---

The goal of my thesis was to present possible use cases for gaze direction to adjust
the context of the scene in a virtual reality game used for eye therapy. Two solutions
of this kind were described.

  <img src="/images/rotation1.jpg" width="49%" /> 
</p>

The first idea relies on changing the transparency of scene
elements for the weak eye depending on in-game progress. The second technique makes
use of eyetracking to help people with strabismus to correct their eye vergence. It allows
to rotate the view for one eye and to slowly guide it to correct position.

In order to demonstrate these solutions a fireman game prototype was implemented using Unity game engine. Specifically for testing purposes a simple eye movement
simulator was wrought. The goal of the thesis was accomplished through the conducted
assessment of discussed methods.
