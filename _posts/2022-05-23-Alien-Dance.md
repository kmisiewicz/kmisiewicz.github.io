title: Creating a music video with Unity Timeline
---

[*Unity, Timeline*] A weekend challenge-project to create a simple music video and learn Unity Timeline.
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/707585398?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="640" height="370" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="aliens &amp; stuff"></iframe>

I wanted to learn how Unity's Timeline works. I was inspired by a music video for a polish rap song [*Delfin*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTnfIaSitk).
I quickly made a beat in FL Studio, found some free assets and laid out scene layout. Unfortunately a humanoid dolphin is rather unusual so I settled for an alien character.
I am quite satisfied with the result considering how quickly it was put together (but I may be biased ;)).
