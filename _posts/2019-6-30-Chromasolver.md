In a group of 4 students we created a game about an astronaut whose ship crashed. He finds mysterious gun that shoots bullets in 3 main colors (red, yellow an blue). He must solve a set of riddles and explore to find a way home. My role was to code the game logic.

The project was in the final of 2019 edition of [ZTGK contest](https://gry.it.p.lodz.pl/main/index.php/pl/news) organized by FTIMS Faculty of Lodz University of Technology in *Game Design* category (27-28.06.2019 r.).
